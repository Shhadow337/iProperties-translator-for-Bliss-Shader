## What is this
A program that translates the technical output from OasisFloodFillGenerator into a shader-ready format.
It contains the basic functionality of the program: merging Oasis with a shader file (tested on Bliss-shader).
- **This tool is tested only on Bliss-Shader; may not work with other shaders**

## Features
- Merge
- Switchable dark mode
- Output file preview with highlighted changes (green - added, blue - changed)

## How to use
1. Download the `.exe`.
2. Prepare the data generated by OasisFloodFillGenerator in a separate folder (e.g., on the desktop).  
   - If you don't know what these files are, see the instructions: [OasisFloodFillGenerator](https://github.com/MikiP98/OasisFloodFillGenerator).
3. Extract the `block.properties` file from your shader (tested only on Bliss-shader).
4. Create a new file named `NEW_block.properties`.
5. Run the program:
   1. Select the RAW file (the Oasis file).
   2. Select the `block.properties` file (the shader file).
   3. Select the final file (the one created in step 4).
6. Check that the data looks correct.
7. Back up your shader and replace the `block.properties` file in it with the generated one.
8. Load the shader, enable floodfill, and check the results.

## Important notes for 14.09.2025
1. When Using [OasisFloodFillGenerator](https://github.com/MikiP98/OasisFloodFillGenerator), remember to:
   - Manually setting the colors for blocks in `block.properties` (before using my tool) - unfortunately this does not work at the moment
      ~~- If you plan to use [Boe's Earth](https://github.com/MikiP98/Boe-s-Earth), remember to remove the blocks named `vine` and `snow` from `block.50=` in the `block.properties` file.~~
      ~~- This is important for the animations to work at all (there's a bug in [OasisFloodFillGenerator](https://github.com/MikiP98/OasisFloodFillGenerator) that causes blocks that already have good mappings to be misused).~~
   - Already fixed in new version 1.1: Script automaticly delets `vine` and `snow` entries from `block.50=`
